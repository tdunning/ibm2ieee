# HFP to IEEE Conversion
This Julia package converts between IBM floating point (aka hexadecimal floating point or HFP) and IEEE floating point.

It is a direct translation of the code by [Enthought](https://pypi.org/project/ibm2ieee/) which seems to be the highest
quality converter in C that I can find.
